summary: This is a quick overview of my research interests and works so far (2013-2025). Mostly prepared for the University of Florence, I appreciate that it gave me the opportunity to highlight - first and foremost for myself - the *fil rouge* in my research. The slides are hosted on the **Open Science Framework** [website](https://osf.io).
